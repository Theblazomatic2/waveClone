These files make up an un finnished game. 

i am getting an error:
  
  in thread "Thread-0" java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "HUD.getLevel()" because "this.hud" is null.
  
  I cant figure out why is says this, because there is no "this.hud".
  
  i have been following a youtube series but i cant seem to figure out what is different from their code. 
  They did not leave a source code.
  
  
  here is the link to the youtube series for refrence:
